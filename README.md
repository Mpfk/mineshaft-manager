# appLaunchpad ðŸš€

appLaunchpad is a Terraform starter pack which provides the foundational elements of a web app. Build on top of it to make deploying your projects easier!

## What does it do?

This project is meant to be a helpful foundation for other projects! Add your own web app to the `/applications/webApp/` folder, then run the deployment instructions below. The scripts will: 

1. Create an AWS Code Commit repository
2. Push your code as an initial commit to that repository
3. Create an Amplify App using the repository
4. Set up production and devleopment branches
5. [Optional] Configure a custom domain through Route 53

Feel free to fork and add additional module which tie into your application.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started with the deployment, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) with appropriate permissions to create resources.
- [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions) installed on your local machine.
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) installed on your local machine.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your local machine.

## Configure AWS Credentials

Before applying changes to the infrastructure, ensure you are logged in to the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) with the correct profile. 

```sh
aws configure
```

### IAM Identity Center (SSO)

If you want to connect to an AWS Organization through IAM Identity Center, use:

```sh
aws sso configure
```

If your temporary credentials have expired, use the following to log back in:

```sh
aws sso login --profile <profile_name>
```

## Deployment

To deploy the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Initialize Terraform:

```sh
cd infrastructure/
terraform init
```

3. Plan the deployment to review the changes, capturing variables in a `terraform.tfplan` file:

```sh
terraform plan -out=terraform.tfplan
```

4. Apply the changes to deploy the infrastructure:

```sh
terraform apply "terraform.tfplan"
```

## Clean up

If you want to permanently delete the resources created by appLaunchpad, destroy the deployed infrastructure with the following command:

```sh
terraform destroy
```

## Variables

The following variables are required:

- [`aws_region`]: The AWS region to deploy resources in.
- [`aws_profile`]: The AWS CLI profile to use.
- [`project`]: The project name to use as a prefix for resource names.

While these variables are optional:

- ['custom_domain']: Creates a Hosted Zone in Route 53 and configuration in Amplify (DEFAULT: `NULL`).
- ['prod_subdomain']: The subdomain for the production branch (DEFAULT: `NULL`).
- ['dev_subdomain']: The subdomain for the development branch (DEFAULT: `dev`).

## Outputs

The project generates the following outputs:

- `repository_url`: The URL of the CodeCommit repository.
- `amplify_app_id`: The ID of the Amplify app.

This is a peronal project I'm making available to others. This is not an official AWS repository, and the code posted here is my own. If you'd like to contribute, submit a pull request. Thanks for stopping by! :)
